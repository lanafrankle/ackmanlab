## Dropbox CMS

Notes from an [article on lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5860139/host-web-pages-for-free-within-dropbox-with-droppages-or-pancakeio) on dropbox public website cms services.

With all these services they are best for small websites, not for big organizations or ones with lots of page hits as there is a dropbox limit per day and you your account can get suspended.

* [Pancake](http://Pancake.io/)
	- Preview common files like word, pdf documents right in browser
	- works with html, js, css, and plain text
	- 'free to sign up'
* [DropPages](http://droppages.com/)

	- content gzipped and cached for best performance possible.
	
* [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/)
	- Personal wiki
	- MacOS and iOS only?
	- $39.95
	- tons of export options
	- sketching
	- unix shell scripting executiable
	- markdown friendly
	- project management

## Markdown to html5 presentations

### Popular html presentation solutions

[rvl.io](http://www.tedcurran.net/2013/02/making-html5-presentations-in-the-cloud-with-markdown-rvl-io/)

>Highly technical GitHub dwellers have long used HTML5 presentations like Impress,js, Reveal.js, and Googleâ€™s HTML5 Rocks Presentations to impress fellow hackers with lean, well designed code and hand-tooled design.

Some are trying to emulate the non-linear prezi format. Some give traditional slide based formatting to markdown documents

[impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored)

[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)  [download latest release](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases)

[MarkdownPresenter](https://github.com/chrishulbert/MarkdownPresenter)



### Reveal.js example

Define slides in index.html using external markdown. Notice the separator could be changed to something else, like a markdown hr:  "^\n---\n"

	<section data-markdown="example.md"  
	         data-separator="^\n\n\n"  
	         data-vertical="^\n\n"  
	         data-notes="^Note:"  
	         data-charset="iso-8859-15">
	</section>

From [reveal.js github readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#full-setup)

Some reveal.js features, like external markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

Install Node.js

Install Grunt

Clone the reveal.js repository

	$ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

Navigate to the reveal.js folder

	$ cd reveal.js

Install dependencies

	$ npm install

Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes

	$ grunt serve

Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation

You can change the port by using grunt serve --port 8001.






### R html presentation solution

[http://slidify.org](http://slidify.org):  Rmarkdown, Rpubs, Rstudio, github, dropbox

 >Built by Slidify. Styled with Bootstrap. Hosted on GitHub. Icons from Font-Awesome. Web fonts from Google. Inspired by Ruhoh

#### Usage example

	library(devtools)
	install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
	install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')
	library(slidify)
	author(slidifyDemo)

Then edit front-matter:

	Title: Slidify Demo
	Subtitle: HTML5 slides from R markdown
	author: name
	job: R hacker

Then make slides after ln 19 `--- .class #id`:

	## Slide 1
	
	Animated list
	> 1. Point 1
	> 2. Point 2
	> 3. Point 3
	
	---
	
	## Motion chart
	
	```{ r echo = F, results = "asis", message = F}
	
	require(googleVis)
	M1 = gvisMotionChart(fruits, idvar = "fruit", timevar = "year')
	print(M1, tag = "chart")
	```

Then click `knit HTML` and it will bring up an html preview.

Can add a line in the front matter for posting to github repo:

	mode   : selfcontained # {standalone, draft}
	github:	
	  user: ramnathv
	  repo: slidifyDemo

Then click `knit HTML` again.

Then publish from Rstudio command line to github:

	publish('ramnathv', 'slidifyDemo')

Or delete the mode and github lines in the header and add:

	mode: standalone

Then click `knit HTML` again.

Then you can click the publish button in the html preview window and it will let you upload documents to Rpubs and enter document details.




## More R markdown awesomeness

The [rpubs](http://www.rpubs.com) site is a place to publish R documents.  Some people have released reports here, small starting community but mostly looks like nice resource for examples.

[Example of network visualization in R](http://www.rpubs.com/Felix/7699)
