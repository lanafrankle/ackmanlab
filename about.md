The Ackman lab is a team of developmental neuroscientists at UC Santa Cruz in the department of [MCD Biology](http://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.html) working to figure out how the brain wires itself together. A better understanding of functional brain development is crucial for the prevention or treatment of many, if not all, neurological diseases, as well as realizing the advances necessary for the brain-machine interfaces of the future.
